# B4 Portfolio Template

## Area of Emphasis

What do you want to focus on this inning? What do you hope to accomplish by graduation?

## Assessment

Include your final outcome (pass/fail) and a reflection based on answering the following questions:
N/A

* What was your biggest technical challenge?
* What did you like the most about the challenge?
* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?
* What did you learn?

## Quantified Self

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

My biggest technical challenge was testing. I could not get the frontend tests to recognize jQuery. I had a lot of trouble testing the backend due to not knowing that a separate command was needed to run the migrations for the test environment. Additonally, PryJS was not working on the backend, so I found testing to be minimally helpful since I couldn't debug the issues with Pry.

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

On the frontend there was no solution as no one I asked seemed to know how to solve it. On the backed I ended up just debugging using the Postgres CLI instead of testing and using Pry. 

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

I liked working with the PG CLI, I think it is was good to remember that it is an option.

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?
- OOP in JS
- Knex
- Express

* If you could change one thing about your technical approach, what would it be and why?

* What was the experience like working with a pair while learning something new?

## Capstone Project

Include a reflection answering the following questions:

* What was your biggest technical challenge?

* How did you solve that challenge? What was your approach?

* What did you like the most about the challenge?

* What are three technical concepts you learned during this project?

## Feedback

What's one piece of meaningful feedback you received during B4? What have you done or going to do regarding this feedback?

## Gear Up

Write a reflection about the process of planning/revising a Gear Up session and facilitating the session. Did you enjoy the experience? What was challenging? What was most rewarding?

## Community Involvement

How else did you give back to the community this inning? Why do you think this is a required part of the Turing experience?

## Going Forward

What three skills (professional and/or technical) are you going to take forward with you during your next job post-Turing?

## Professional Development

* Link to 30-day post-grad job search action plan using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md): 
* Prepare a summarized version of your professional story to share during the portfolio review. This is a 1-2 minute sharing highlighting who you are, why you are in software, and what's next in your career.
* Prepare and share your Turing story during week six.
